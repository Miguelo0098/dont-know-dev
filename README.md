Miguelo's personal blog running on Astro ðŸš€

This repo was created for my own use. It does not intent to be a template for a blog, so it's not designed with the intention of being cloned and deployed.

You can use the Astro blog template like this:

```sh
$ npx create astro@latest -- --template blog
```
